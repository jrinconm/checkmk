README for Lasso Integration Tests
==================================

Requirements:
 - twill (apt-get install python-twill)
 - nose (apt-get install python-nose)
 - Authentic & LCS from Subversion and CVS



Default configuration is to look for apps in their installation directories,
but it is also possible to run tests without installing anything.  Example of a
config file is in tests/config.py.example (must be renamed to config.py to be
effective). You can also place a configuration file in
~/.config/lasso_integration.conf, the format is "key = value" without any
quoting.

Tests are run with nosetests from this directory.

You can use the following environement variables to fine tune the execution of
the tests:
        - LASSO_BUILDDIR, to specify an out of source build directory to
          test,
        - NO_SILENT, to allow authentic and lcs outputs,
        - VALGRIND, to check memory leaks using valgrind.
