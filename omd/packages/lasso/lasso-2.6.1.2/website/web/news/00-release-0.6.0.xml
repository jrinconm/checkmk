 <h3>2005-01-17: Released 0.6.0</h3>

 <p>
  I am pleased to announce the release of Lasso 0.6.0.
  <a href="/download/">Download it now</a>
 </p>

 <p class="changes">
  <strong>What changed ?</strong>   Library internals were rewritten to use
  standard structures instead of libxml2 nodes; this allows <a
  href="/perfs">faster processing</a>,
  more flexibility and better support for language bindings.  All the <a
  href="/documentation/api-reference/index.html">API
  functions</a> were documented.  And many fixes and improvements found their way.
