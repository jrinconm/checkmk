  <strong>What changed ?</strong>
  Improved behaviour when confronted to other Liberty providers that do not
  implement all the mandatory Liberty requirements, improved error status code
  reporting, completed support for public keys embedded in metadata files,
  fixed a few corner case bugs.  Also continued work on ID-WSF support,
  implementing Discovery and DST services but still considered experimental
  and disabled by default.
