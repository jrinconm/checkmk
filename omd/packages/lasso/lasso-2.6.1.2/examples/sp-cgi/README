Starting
========

To run this CGI SAML 2.0 SP, you must:

- configure Apache (or any other web-service handling CGI scripts) for
	running CGI scripts
- compile this script by doing:

   make

- put all projects files in a directory readable and *writable* (for session
	files) by Apache2. The script test.cgi should be accessible through the URL
	http://yourdomain.com/.../test.cgi.
- retrieve the metadata content on http://yourdomain.com/.../test.cgi/metadata and put them
	in a file named metadata.xml
- register on https://openidp.feide.no/ and upload the `metadata.xml` file on
	https://openidp.feide.no/simplesaml/module.php/metaedit/index.php
- go on http://yourdomain.com/.../test.cgi/login and see that SAML 2.0 login is working
